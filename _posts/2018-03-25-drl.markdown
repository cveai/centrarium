*In this page I summarize in a succinct and straighforward fashion what I learn from [Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkFD6_40KJIznC9CDbVTjAF2oyt8_VAe3){:target="_blank"} course by Sergey Levine, along with my own thoughts and related resources.*
*I will update this page frequently, like every week, until it's complete.*

#### (8/23) Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

**Markov chain**

$\mathscr{M} = (\mathscr{S}, \mathscr{T})$  
* $\mathscr{S}$ (state space)  /  $s \in \mathscr{S}$ (state)  
* $\mathscr{T} = p: \mathscr{S} \times \mathscr{S} \rightarrow [0,1]$ (transition operator, linear)  *
