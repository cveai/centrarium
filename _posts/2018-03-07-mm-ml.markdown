*In this page I summarize in a succinct and straighforward fashion what I learn from [Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDLKJtOVx5c&list=PLD0F06AA0D2E8FFBA){:target="_blank"} course by Mathematical Monk, along with my own thoughts and related resources.*
*I will update this page frequently, like every other day, until it's complete.*

**Acronyms**
* MM: Mathematical Monk
* ML: Machine Learning
* SL: Supervised Learning
* UL: Unsupervised Learning

#### (ML 1.1) What is machine learning?

"Designing *algorithms* for inferring what is unknown from knowns."

MM considers ML as a subfield of statistics, with emphasis on algorithms.

Got to read an interesting article [Machine Learning vs. Statistics](https://svds.com/machine-learning-vs-statistics/){:target="_blank"}, thanks to [Whi Kwon](https://whikwon.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.

**Applications**
 * Spam (filtering out)
 * Handwriting (recognition)
 * Google streetview
 * Netflix (recommendation systems)
 * Navigation
 * Climate modelling

#### (ML 1.2) What is supervied learning?

 Classification of ML problems: Supervised vs. Unsupervised
 
**Supervised**: Given $(x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), \ldots, (x^{(n)}, y^{(n)})$ choose a *function* $f(x) = y$.

> $x^{(i)}$ : data points
> $y^{(i)}$ : class/value/label

 * Classification: $y^{(i)} \in \\{$finite set$\\}$
 * Regression: $y^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}$ or $y^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^d$

#### (ML 1.3) What is unsupervied learning?

**Supervised**: Given $x^{(1)}, \ldots, x^{(n)}$, find *patterns* in the data.
* Clustering
* Density estimation
* Dimensionality reduction
