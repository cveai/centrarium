*In this page I summarize in a succinct and straighforward fashion what I learn from [Convex Optimization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4ubu7BlSk&list=PL17567A1A3F5DB5E4){:target="_blank"} course by Stephen Boyd, along with my own thoughts and related resources.*
*I will update this page frequently, like every week, until it's complete.*

#### (Lecxture 9) Numerical linear algebra background

The main goral of the third and the last section (Lectures 9--12) of the course is to *demystify* how is is to solve these convex optimization problems.

It is very important for everyone to know a little bit about how these problems are solved, and specifically the link between problem structure and how fast we can solve it.

**Matrix structure and algorithm complexity**

Cost of solving $Ax = b$ (A \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n})
* $n^3$, for general methods
* less, if $A$ is structured (banded, sparse, Toeplitz, ...)
