*This is the master page for Notes on Machine Learning posts, in which I summarize in a succinct and straighforward fashion what I learn from [Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDLKJtOVx5c&list=PLD0F06AA0D2E8FFBA){:target="_blank"} course by Mathematical Monk, along with my own thoughts and related resources.*

* To understand **bias-variance "trade-off"**, take a quick route:  
(11.5) $\leadsto$ (11.1) (11.2) (11.3) (11.4) $\leadsto$ (11.1) (11.2) 

Some other helpful resources:
