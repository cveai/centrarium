*In this page I summarize in a succinct and straighforward fashion what I learn from the book [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/lecture_slides.html){:target="_blank"} by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville, along with my own thoughts and related resources.*
*I will update this page frequently, like every week, until it's complete.*

#### (6.1) Example: Learning XOR

**Target function:**

$$y = f^*(x) = f^*([x_1, x_2]^T) = XOR(x_1, x_2)$$

where $x = [x_1, x_2]^T \in \\{0, 1\\}^2$.

**Linear Esimator:**

$$\hat{y} = f(x: \theta) = f(x; (w, b)) = x^T + b$$  
where $w = [w_1, w_2]^T \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}$.
