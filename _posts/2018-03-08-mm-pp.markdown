*In this page I summarize in a succinct and straighforward fashion what I learn from [Probability Primer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk4ubu7BlSk&list=PL17567A1A3F5DB5E4){:target="_blank"} course by Mathematical Monk, along with my own thoughts and related resources.*
*I will update this page frequently, like every other day, until it's complete.*
