#### (PP 6.8) Marginal distributions of a Gaussian

One of the weird and wonderful things is: the family of Gaussians is preserved under many different operations.

**Proposition.(Marginalization)**

#### (PP 6.9) Conditional distributions of a Gaussian

**Proposition.(Conditional)**

#### (PP 6.10) Sum of independent Gaussians

**Proposition.** If $X \sim N(\mu_X, C_X)$ and $X \sim N(\mu_X, C_X)$, then $X+Y \sim N(\mu_X + \mu_Y, C_X + C_y)$. 

**Remark.**
* $E(X+y) = E(X) + X(Y)$
* ${\rm Cov}(X+Y) = {\rm Cov}(X) + {\rm Cov}(Y)$
