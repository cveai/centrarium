*In this page I summarize in a succinct and straighforward fashion what I learn from [Convex Optimization](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/CVX101/Winter2014/about){:target="_blank"} course by Stephen Boyd, along with my own thoughts and related resources.*
*I will update this page frequently, like every week, until it's complete.*

#### (Lecture 9) Numerical linear algebra background

The main goal of the third and the last section (Lectures 9--12) of the course is to *demystify* how it is that we solve these convex optimization problems.

It is very important for everyone to know a little bit about how these problems are solved, and specifically the link between problem structure and how fast we can solve it.

**Matrix structure and algorithm complexity**

Cost of solving linear system $Ax = b$ ($A \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n})$:
* $n^3$, for general methods
* less, if $A$ is structured (banded, [sparse](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-sparse-matrix-What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-a-sparse-matrix){:target="_blank"}, Toeplitz, ...)
