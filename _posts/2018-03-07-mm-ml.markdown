*In this page I summarize in a succinct and straighforward fashion what I learn from [Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDLKJtOVx5c&list=PLD0F06AA0D2E8FFBA) course by Mathematical Monk along with my own thoughts and related resources.*
*I will update this page frequently, like every other day, until it's complete.*

#### (ML 1.1) What is maachine learning?

"Designing *algorithms* for inferring what is unknown from knowns."

MM (Mathematical Monk) considers ML as a subfield of statistics, with emphasis on algorithms.

Got to read an interesting article [Machine Learning vs. Statistics](https://svds.com/machine-learning-vs-statistics/), thanks to [Whi Kwon](https://whikwon.github.io/).

**Applications**
 * Spam (filtering out)
 * Handwriting (recognition)
 * Google streetview
 * Netflix (recommendation systems)
 * Navigation
 * Climate modelling

#### (ML 1.2) What is supervied learning?

 Classification of LM problems:
 * Supervised
